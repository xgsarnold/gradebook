#Grade Book

This application allows teachers, students, and parents to log in to manage or view their materials. Teachers have full authorization to create, edit, and delete other teachers or students, parents, and grades connected to their own students. Students and parents, however, only have authorization to view grades linked to that specific student or to update their profile.

If a user attempts to access material for which they have no authorization, they are redirected to their previous page and alerted.
